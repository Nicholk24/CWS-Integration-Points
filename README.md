# CWS Integration Points

Integration provied software developers with specific and unique tools with options for connecting to the destination of the enterprise platforms. CWS provides integration access to professional, opportunity, resume and requisition, and supplier from VMS granting easy access to Self-Source via XMS through integration of a Single API by using REST implementation methodologies.

CWS uses XMS data integration to ensure that both systems are consistent by applying point-to-point connections to avoid creating unnecessary dependencies and unmaintainable complex structures.  In order for data integration to remain consistent within all systems being integrated, meaning VMS\/XMS\/CWS, it will need to extract the business processes from available applications to be implemented within that particular system.

In the event the business applications are replaced with a different vendor application, the business rule will not need to be re-implemented. The legacy systems that need to be linked together may reside on a different operating system or database solutions. This document is for internal use only and should serve as a reference tool for Integration Point within CWS and XMS. This is an on-going process and subject to change based upon updated information.
